    "**RQ 1.1:** We lemmatise words to get an easier count of how many times each word occurs, instead of having to account for each different variation of the same word. For stop words, we remove them because they do not add anything to the meaning of a sentance, and can therefore be ignored when looking for keywords. Leaving stop words in would also skew the results, because they occur in every description, and would therefore have both a high term frequency and a low inverse document frequency.\n",
    "If we are searching for documents pertaining to products of a specific company, where all documents contain the company name, that name might be considered a stop word. For example, if we're looking at product pages from Apple, we might ignore words like Apple, MacOS, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ 1.2:** The number of rows in X represents the number of documentes we are searching through, and the number of columns is the number of terms we are using to search, after lemmatising and removing stop words. When we do this, we preserve all keywords important terms in a document, but we lose the sentance structure and the actual \"meaning\" of the sentance. For example, \"is the cat buying\" gets simplified down to [\"cat\" \"buy\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ 1.3:** A high idf represents a term that only occurs in a small number of documents, whereas a low idf means it's a more common word that occurs in several documents. Based on this, we could potentially identify stop words by looking at words that occur in almost every document, meaning they have an idf approaching 0. For example, words like \"the\", or \"an\" occur in pretty much every document, and fairly often, so they likely have a high term frequency and a very low idf.\n",
    "The reason we don't use idf on it's own is that it only indicates how many documents it appears in, not how often it is used. And example for why using only idf on its own as a term weighing would be classical screenplays, like those by Shakespeare, that always end with the word \"fin\". Using idf on it's own would highlight this as one of the most common words in all screenplays, whereas in reality it only occurs once per document."
